                            Moondawg Media started from humble beginnings in a small basement with big dreams. 
                            Our founders, <code>name</code>, met at a music festival in the summer of 2022.
                             Though they came from different backgrounds, they shared a passion for using media to uplift others.

                            With little more than a couple laptops, their creative sparks, and some ramen noodles, 
                            Luna and Sirius got to work. They toiled through many sleepless nights to build their vision. 
                            The early days were filled with challenges, but the desire to follow their purpose kept them going.

                        <p>
                            It wasn't easy, but bit by bit their hard work paid off.
                             As word spread about Moondawg's artsy vibe and stellar customer service, clients started rolling in. 
                             The team expanded from just Luna and Sirius to a pack of 10 creative wolves. 
                             Their humble basement studio transformed into a thriving agency. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            Today, Moondawg Media is a leading full-service creative firm.
                             We've produced award-winning work for businesses across the country.

                            We may have grown rapidly, but our core values remain. 
                            Moondawg continues to operate with the same scrappy spirit, dedication, and customer-centric approach that defined our early days.
                            We still see ourselves as a pack of creatives on a mission to build community through our work. 
                            The moon guides our way as we fearlessly embark on new frontiers.
                            Though the future is unknown, our passion and vision remain unwavering. 
                            We can't wait to see what the next phase has in store under the moon's magical glow. Awooo!
